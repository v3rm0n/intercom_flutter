    - Intercom iOS SDK v11 requires minimum deployment target version 13. So iOS minimum version is updated from 10 to 13. See https://github.com/intercom/intercom-ios/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#1100
    - The service `io.maido.intercom.PushInterceptService` is deleted. Now plugin itself will handle the push messages using the new added receiver `io.maido.intercom.PushInterceptReceiver`.
      - remove the service `io.maido.intercom.PushInterceptService`, if you have, from your `AndroidManifest.xml`.
      - remove the code to handle the background Intercom push from your `firebase_messaging` background handler. Now it is not required to handle manually.
